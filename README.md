# Login-screen
Login Screen developed with HTML and CSS

I used some ```<form>``` ```<inputs>```. The idea was to practice the use of these tags.

Furthermore, I studed some CSS pseudo-class working some ```<button>``` ```<input type="submit">``` behaviors while ```:hover``` and ```<focus>```.

I deepended my knowledge in some tags customization, changing the elements display and using the box-sizing property.

Also, I made the inputs 'required' using the attribute.

This project was developed to study the components, attributes and CSS customization that I mentioned.
